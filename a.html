    <p><h1>The cover screen software for the Galaxy Z Flip 5 outperforms Motorola's in all but one category.</h1></p>
<p>Although Samsung provides a better experience overall, Motorola does cover screen apps better.</p>
<p>We now have our first flip phones with large cover displays in the US (  everyone in China and Europe has alternatives). The Motorola Razr Plus was the phone that made me a cover screen believer – I find it beneficial for running a few full apps I use for basic chores as well as checking brief information.</p>
<p>I have therefore been very interested to see Samsung's interpretation of a large cover screen on the Z Flip 5. Even after only a few days with the Flip 5, I'm ready to declare it the cover screen winner, with the exception of when it comes to running full-fledged apps. I'm still testing the phone out.</p>
<p>Hardware-wise, the screen of the Razr Plus is nicer. It has a smooth 144Hz panel with 413ppi, compared to the Flip 5's regular 60Hz screen with 306ppi. This difference in resolution is obvious when comparing the two devices side by side. But when it comes to software experience alone, Samsung is far ahead.</p>
<p>To begin with, there is a genuine always-on display. A lot more options exist for personalizing your cover screen wallpaper. You can edit the filter and frame of a photo. Decide whether to make your battery level and app icon notifications visible or live a more tranquil life without them. Motorola offers much less options; you can just choose your wallpaper and decide whether you want shortcuts to your widget panels.</p>
<p>On the Z Flip 5, widgets are also considerably more useful. Both devices have widgets that you can swipe between that fill the "panels" of the cover screen, but Motorola uses them in a much more conventional way by providing specific information at a glance. The "widgets" from Samsung are really just little apps. For instance, Motorola's calendar widget can only show the complete month or a daily schedule view with a few event information. Your daily schedule and a calendar are displayed in Samsung's default layout, and you may press events to view more information.</p>
<p>Samsung has a significant advantage in this area because it is clearly recycling some of the concepts present on its smartwatches. I greatly appreciate the way the Razr Plus manages running complete programs, despite its lackluster widgets. Any app on your phone can be run on the cover screen, and you can choose whether you want it to go to the outer screen when you close the phone from a menu in the external display settings. nice and simple On the Flip 5, it's a different story.</p>
<p>When you enable it, there are only a few apps available (namely Google Maps and a few messaging apps), and Samsung hides the option to run apps on the cover screen in the Labs part of its settings menu. You must download MultiStar, a separate module, and Good Lock from the Galaxy app store in order to accomplish anything else. By doing this, you add a new app launcher panel to the one you had set up on the cover screen for Google Maps and Messages.</p>
<p>The Razr Plus makes it simpler to use apps. The keyboard that appears includes a persistent input field, unlike Samsung's, so you can always see what you're typing. As a result, the input area occasionally disappears behind the keyboard and other UI components in apps like Google Translate, causing you to lose it. It kind of dampens your enthusiasm when you want to impress your friends with a speedy translation, but it also serves as an example of why Samsung really wants to keep this feature hidden.</p>
<p>As much as a flip phone sicko like myself enjoys pushing these cover screens to their absolute limits, it's safe to say that most buyers of the Flip 5 or Razr Plus don't want to run a ton of apps on the front panel. This explains why Samsung would make the choice unavailable to the majority of users and why the cover screen keyboard wasn't designed with most apps in mind. We can only hope that these two businesses will cooperate to push for improved cover screen experiences in the upcoming flip phones for all of us, sickos and not.</p>
